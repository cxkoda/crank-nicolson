# Crank-Nicolson with DevOps

This project is a demonstration implementation of a Crank-Nicolson scheme to solve a basic diffusion equation in one dimension.

It's purpose was to exercise common DevOps such as
* A common code style (using clang-format)
* Auto-formatting using git-hooks
* Setting up a build system using cmake
* Unit-testing using gtest
* CI using Travis

And to act as a lookup project for future ones.
