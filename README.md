# Crank-Nicolson with DevOps
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cxkoda/crank-nicolson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cxkoda/crank-nicolson)

In this project I would like to learn and exercise some of the most common DevOps such as:
* Using a defined code style (using clang-format)
* Auto-formatting using git-hooks
* Setting up a build system (using cmake)
* Unit-testing (using googltest)
* Conitnuous-integration (using Travis)

I exercise this in the context of implementing a Crank-Nicolson scheme to solve a basic diffusion equation in one spatial dimension.

This project is intended to serve as a lookup project for future ones.

Be aware that everything is still **work in progress**!
